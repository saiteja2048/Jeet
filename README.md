# Jeet
This repository is about providing ebooks related to JEE advanced and NEET for the students by using web application as user interface.
The idea of the project is to help the students who are not able to purchase the books of JEE and NEET by providing free ebooks . This might help them to learn from books of the best authors and help them to crack the exam.Chatbot is also deployed by using Microsoft azure QNA maker to solve the queries related to subject  books.so I think this project might help the students atleast for some extent and we'll try to add more services  if needed according to the students need.
